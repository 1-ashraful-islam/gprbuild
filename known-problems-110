KP-110-H421-024 Find correctly all Ada sources

  Problem:    When the naming scheme is seemingly ambiguous such that the same
              file could be of two kinds (spec/body) (example spec suffix =
              "_.ada", body suffix = ".ada") the project manager was not always
              finding all the sources.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.2.0 on 2008-04-22

  Workaround: Use a non ambiguous naming scheme

KP-110-H404-017 gprbuild should fails for declared source not found

  Problem:    gprbuild does not detect that a source, declared with
              attribute Source_Files or Source_List_File cannot be found.
              It sjould fail in this case.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.2.0 on 2008-03-05

  Workaround: Do not declare sources that do not exist
