This file contains a complete list of new features in version 1.5 of GPRBUILD.
A full description of all GPRBUILD features can be found in the GPRBUILD
User's Guide.

An ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) appears in parentheses after the description line.
This date shows the implementation date of the feature. Any 1.4.0w
wavefront subsequent to this date will contain the indicated feature, as
will any subsequent releases.

NF-15-J928-007 Indexed variables in knowledge base (2010-10-04)

  To avoid an ambiguity in the <configuration> nodes when multiple
  compilers are selected, the substitution variables need to be indexed by
  the language of the corresponding compiler.

NF-15-J915-016 No linking with GNAT libs with -nostdlib (2010-09-17)

  When a shared library is linked and -nostdlib is in the library options, then
  the GNAT libraries are not used for the link.

NF-15-J614-021 New command line switch --source-info= (2010-06-29)

  A new command line switch is added to gprbuild, to read a source info file,
  instead of looking for sources. If the source info file does not exist, it is
  created, so that subsequent invocation of gprbuild may use it.

NF-15-J614-004 Recompilation if ALI file newer than object file (2010-06-15)

  If the gprbuild finds that an ALI file is newer than the corresponding
  object file, then the corresponding source is recompiled, as the object
  file was not produced at the same time the ALI file was produced.

NF-15-J325-005 New attributes for leading options (2010-04-12)

  New attributes Leading_Library_Options and Linker'Leading_Switches are
  added.

NF-15-IC02-005 New switch -x (2009-12-07)

  gprbuild no longer create an include path file to the compiler, except when
  the new switch -x is used. This is to improve performances.

NF-15-IB26-022 New switch -R (2009-11-26)

  gprbuid now recognizes the gnatmake switch -R. When this switch is specified,
  no run path option is used when linking executables and shared libraries.

NF-15-IB20-033 New switch --no-object-check (2009-11-23)

  A new switch --no-object-check is added to gprbuild. When this switch is
  used, the object files are not checked, the switch files are not checked even
  when switch -s is used and there is no binding or linking.

NF-15-IA18-001 No shared libgnat by default with C++ (2009-10-20)

  When Ada and C++ are used, the shared versions of the GNAT libraries
  are no longer used by default. However, the shared version of libgcc
  is always used.

NF-15-I713-006 Relative paths in the run path option (2009-10-21)

  For platforms where the linker supports -z origin and $ORIGIN in the run
  path option, use paths relative to the exec directory in the run path
  option.

NF-15-I416-017 Builder switches when there is no main (2010-06-02)

  When there is no main specified and there is only one compiled language
  in the main project, gprbuild now takes into account the builder switches
  for this language in package Builder of the main project.

NF-15-HA09-027 Gprbuild support for GNAAMP (2010-05-07)

   Gprbuild has been adapted for use with GNAAMP and will now properly invoke
   the gnaamp compiler and related tools.
