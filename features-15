NF-15-J107-014 Compilation switches and Stand-Alone Libraries (2010-01-11)

  The Ada leading and trailing switches are now used to compile the binder
  generated files of Stand-Alone Libraries.

NF-15-IC02-005 New switch -x (2009-12-07)

  gprbuild no longer create an include path file to the compiler, except when
  the new switch -x is used. This is to improve performances.

NF-15-IB26-022 New switch -R (2009-11-26)

  gprbuid now recognizes the gnatmake switch -R. When this switch is specified,
  no run path option is used when linking executables and shared libraries.

NF-15-IB20-033 New switch --no-object-check (2009-11-23)

  A new switch --no-object-check is added to gprbuild. When this switch is
  used, the object files are not checked, the switch files are not checked even
  when switch -s is used and there is no binding or linking.

NF-15-IA18-001 No shared libgnat by default with C++ (2009-10-20)

  When Ada and C++ are used, the shared versions of the GNAT libraries
  are no longer used by default. However, the shared version of libgcc
  is always used.

NF-15-I713-006 Relative paths in the run path option (2009-10-21)

  For platforms where the linker supports -z origin and $ORIGIN in the run
  path option, use paths relative to the exec directory in the run path
  option.
