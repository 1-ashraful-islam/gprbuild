NF-16-K331-022 Clear message for command line switch in Builder (2011-04-04)

  When a gprbuild switch that is only valid on the command line is found in
  package Builder of the main project, gprbuild fails with a clear message
  indicating that the switch "can only be used on the command line".

NF-16-K316-038 Warning when not using Builder'Switches (2011-03-17)

  When compiling several mains at once, gprbuild ignores the Builder'Switches
  specific to those mains, and use the switches for their common language
  instead (if any). Gprbuild will now issue a warning in such cases, that
  it hasn't used the main-specific switches.

NF-16-K310-024 Relative file names on the gprbuild command line (2011-03-10)

  For compatibility with gnatmake, gprbuild now accepts file names relative
  to the current directory on its command line.

NF-16-K310-021 Allow unit names on the gprbuild command line (2011-03-10)

  For compatibility with gnatmake, gprbuild now accepts unit names on the
  command line.

NF-16-K223-006 --RTS switches in package Builder (2011-04-01)

  When configuration project file is auro-generated and there are no switches
  --RTS on the command line, the switches --RTS found in package Builder of the
  main project are taken into account to invoke gprconfig and produce the
  configuration project file.

NF-16-JA11-035 New gprbuild switches -vl, -vm and -vh (2010-10-12)

  Three new switches are added to gprbuild: -vl, -vm and -vh, similar to
  the same switches for gnatmake. They are accepted on the command line and
  in package Builder.
