Copyright (C) 2010-2011, AdaCore

This file contains a complete list of new features in version 1.6 of GPRBUILD.
A full description of all GPRBUILD features can be found in the GPRBUILD
User's Guide.

An ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) appears in parentheses after the description line.
This date shows the implementation date of the feature. Any 1.6.0w
wavefront subsequent to this date will contain the indicated feature, as
will any subsequent releases.

NF-16-K907-021 Default config file created by gprconfig (2011-09-22)

  The default config project file created by gprconfig is now default.cgpr in
  the current working directory, instead of <prefix>/share/gpr/default.cgpr.
  This will prevent the involuntary creation of a global config file.

NF-16-K621-023 Warning when --create-map-file is not supported (2011-06-21)

  When option --create-map-file is not supported (that is attribute
  Linker'Map_File_Option is not declared in the configuration project file),
  gprbuild issues a warning if this option is used.

NF-16-K408-001 New attributes Dependency_Kind and Language_Kind (2011-04-21)

  Two new configuration attributes are added in package Compiler:
  Dependency_Kind and Language_Kind. By default, for Ada, language kind
  is unit based and dependency kind is ALI file. For other languages,
  language kind is file based and dependency kind is Makefile.
  These attributes may be overriden in user projects.
  No change of functionality if they are not overriden.

NF-16-K331-022 Clear message for command line switch in Builder (2011-04-04)

  When a gprbuild switch that is only valid on the command line is found in
  package Builder of the main project, gprbuild fails with a clear message
  indicating that the switch "can only be used on the command line".

NF-16-K316-038 Warning when not using Builder'Switches (2011-03-17)

  When compiling several mains at once, gprbuild ignores the Builder'Switches
  specific to those mains, and use the switches for their common language
  instead (if any). Gprbuild will now issue a warning in such cases, that
  it hasn't used the main-specific switches.

NF-16-K310-024 Relative file names on the gprbuild command line (2011-03-10)

  For compatibility with gnatmake, gprbuild now accepts file names relative
  to the current directory on its command line.

NF-16-K310-021 Allow unit names on the gprbuild command line (2011-03-10)

  For compatibility with gnatmake, gprbuild now accepts unit names on the
  command line.

NF-16-K223-006 --RTS switches in package Builder (2011-04-01)

  When configuration project file is auto-generated and there are no switches
  --RTS on the command line, the switches --RTS found in package Builder of the
  main project are taken into account to invoke gprconfig and produce the
  configuration project file.

NF-16-K103-005 Duplicate source file names when no compiler (2011-04-05)

  When the compiler driver for a language is empty (""), it is now allowed
  to have duplicat source file names in any source directory of a project,
  even if they are in the same subdirectory tree specified with the ".../**"
  notation.

NF-16-JA11-035 New gprbuild switches -vl, -vm and -vh (2010-10-12)

  Three new switches are added to gprbuild: -vl, -vm and -vh, similar to
  the same switches for gnatmake. They are accepted on the command line and
  in package Builder.

NF-16-H414-002 Support for aggregate projects (2011-03-15)

  A new concept was added to the project facility: aggregate projects. These
  can be used to group together two or more independent projects, and compile
  all their main units through a single command. See the documentation for
  more use cases. The support is not complete yet, and in particular gprbuild
  is missing a number of consistency checks, but the feature is already
  useful as is.

NF-16-H320-021 Support for aggregate library projects (2011-07-17)

  A new concept was added to the project facility: aggregate library
  projects.  These can be used to group together two or more
  independent projects and to build a single library out of the
  object files compiled from all those aggregated projects. The
  support is not complete yet, and in particular gprbuild is missing a
  number of consistency checks, but the feature is already useful as is.
