KP-210-MB05-034 gprinstall fails to install projects built with sub-dirs

  Problem:    gprinstall is not able to install a code which has been
              built with gprbuild's --subdirs option.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2013-11-05

  Workaround: Install the code manually.

KP-210-MB05-020 gprconfig does not detect non GNAT gcc C and g++ compilers

  Problem:    gprconfig does not find all non GNAT gcc C and g++ compilers.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2013-11-07

  Workaround: Manually edit a configuration project file and use it with
              gprbuild.

KP-210-MA31-004 Aggregated libraries and externally built

  Problem:    gprbuild was not properly dealing with externally built
              projects on the dependencies. First it was trying to add the
              object code from such libraries and failed to pass the library
              on to the linker.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2013-11-01

  Workaround: Remove the externally built projects from the dependencies if
              possible and pass the corresponding library to the linker.

KP-210-MA30-041 Aggregated libraries and gprinstall

  Problem:    gprinstall was not properly handling aggregate libraries. The
              installation was failing and/or the generated project was not
              usable.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2013-11-02

  Workaround: Install the software using a script.
