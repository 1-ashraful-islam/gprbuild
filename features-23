NF-23-NC03-007 Invoke the correct gnatbind for unknown targets (2014-02-03)

  When gprbuild is invoked with an unkown target and the Ada compiler is
  found by gprconfig, the correct gnatbind for the target is now used,
  instead of the native one.

NF-23-NA15-003 GPRinstall new --no-build-var option (2014-11-21)

  A new option --no-build-var has been introduced and is meant to be
  use for project with a single configuration (single installation).
  In this case there is no build/scenario variable generated.

NF-23-NA14-036 GPRinstall Mode & Install_Name attributes (2014-12-10)

  It is now possible to set the Mode and Install_Name value in the
  package Install of a project. These attributes are equivalent to the
  GPSinstall command line options but allow per project fine tuning of
  the installation setup.
