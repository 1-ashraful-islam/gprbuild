Copyright (C) 2014-2015, AdaCore

This file contains a complete list of new features in version 2.3 of GPRBUILD.
A full description of all GPRBUILD features can be found in the GPRBUILD
User's Guide.

NF-23-O420-012 --create-map-file for cross targets (2015-04-21)

  This is now supported on cross platforms that use GNU ld to link.

NF-23-O325-017 Out of tree build (2015-03-29)

  gprbuild can now build a project file out of a the source tree. That is,
  all artifacts (object, executable, ALI files) are relocated to the directory
  where gprbuild is launched when using the new --relocate-build-tree option.

  The --relocate-build-tree option is also available with gprinstall and
  gprclean to install artifacts or delete them from the out-of-tree build
  directory.

NF-23-O224-040 GPRbuild distributed environment variables (2015-04-12)

  gprbuild and gprslave now accepts slaves to be specified using environment
  variables. Either GPR_SLAVES which contains a coma separated list of host
  names or GPR_SLAVES_FILE with specify a file whose content must be an host
  name per line.

NF-23-O127-044 New gprbuild switch -z (2015-01-26)

  gprbuild now accepts the switch -z to build executable with no main
  subprogram, as gnatmake already does.

NF-23-O126-001 Warnings when interface of a SAL is incomplete (2015-01-27)

  When gprbuild is invoked without -q, it checks if the interface of a SAL
  is complete, and warn if units of the project that are imported by the
  interface units are not themselves in the interface.

NF-23-NC04-012 Linking with --lto=nn when -jnn and --lto are used (2014-12-18)

  When gprbuild is invoked with -jnn (nn > 1) and with the linker switch
  --lto (or -flto), the linker is invoked with --lto=nn (or -flto=nn) to speed
  up linking.

NF-23-NC03-007 Invoke the correct gnatbind for unknown targets (2014-02-03)

  When gprbuild is invoked with an unkown target and the Ada compiler is
  found by gprconfig, the correct gnatbind for the target is now used,
  instead of the native one.

NF-23-NA15-003 GPRinstall new --no-build-var option (2014-11-21)

  A new option --no-build-var has been introduced and is meant to be
  use for project with a single configuration (single installation).
  In this case there is no build/scenario variable generated.

NF-23-NA14-036 GPRinstall Mode & Install_Name attributes (2014-12-10)

  It is now possible to set the Mode and Install_Name value in the
  package Install of a project. These attributes are equivalent to the
  GPSinstall command line options but allow per project fine tuning of
  the installation setup.

NF-23-NA07-058 Dependency with different timestamp (2015-03-13)

  gprbuild now recompiles a file based source if one of its dependency source
  has a different time stamp, even when the time stamp is before the one of
  the object file.
