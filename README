Building and Installing
=======================

Requirements:
   - You need access to part of part of the GNAT sources.
     These sources are either packaged directly with the source package
     for gprconfig and gprmake (in a subdirectory called gnat/), or you
     access them by some other means (direct access to the repository,
     download of the GNAT source package,...)
     In the last two cases, you can either create a local link called
     "gnat" that points to the directory containing src/prj.ads, or
     use the --with-gnat-source-dir=<dir> switch

     One convenient way is to run the following script in the directory
     that contains this README:
         if [ -d gnat ]; then
            (cd gnat; cvs -d nile:/nile.c/cvs/Dev update -r gprmake-2006)
         else
             cvs -d nile:/nile.c/cvs/Dev co -r gprmake-2006 gnat/
         fi
         (cd gnat;
             cvs update -A MANIFEST.GPRMAKE
             cvs update -f `cat MANIFEST.GPRMAKE`)
         svn update

Compiling:
   - Execute the usual commands:
       ./configure
       or  ./configure --with-gnat-source-dir=<dir>

       make
