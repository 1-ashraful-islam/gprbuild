in this document.

Known problems fixed in 17.1 and above
--------------------------------------

KP-23-P202-046 Export symbols in the BSS section when needed

  Problem:    GPRbuild fails to export symbols in the BSS section
              when building a SAL (Standalone Shared Library).

  Status:     This was fixed in 17 on 2016-02-04

  Workaround: Provide an explicit list of all exported symbols using the
              Lib_Symbol_File attribute.

KP-23-P125-003 Standalone library with child units installation issue

  Problem:    GPRinstall won't install a compilable standalone library
              project if a child unit is part of the interface.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17 on 2016-01-25

  Workaround: Fix manually the generated Library_Interface attribute.

KP-23-P112-067 Included_Artifact_Patterns ignored

  Problem:    The GPRbuild distributed attribute Included_Artifact_Patterns
              is not taken into account.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17 on 2016-01-20

  Workaround: Copy manually the artifacts from the slaves (e.g using rsync)

KP-23-OC21-017 Restricted languages and auto configuration

  Problem:    When gprbuild is invoked with switches --restricted-to-languages=
              or --codepeer, the languages that should be used for the
              invocation of gprconfig in auto configuration are the restricted
              languages.
              In CodePeer mode, the only language to consider is Ada.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17 on 2015-12-21

  Workaround: Do not declare languages other than the restricted ones.

KP-23-OC17-040 Index case-sensitivity for attribute Global_Compilation_Switches

  Problem:    When the value of attribute Builder'Global_Compilation_Switches
              is asked through GNATCOLL.Projects.Attribute_Value, the wrong
              result may be returned as the index is incorrectly
              case-sensitive.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17 on 2015-12-26

  Workaround: Use the exact same language name as in the declaration in the
              project file.

KP-23-OB30-037 GPRinstall fails installing main with specific naming

  Problem:    When the Main attribute was specified without extension and
              the Binder's Executable attribute with an extension the
              specified name was not found. In this case GPRinstall failed
              as it was not able to find the executable to install.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17 on 2015-12-05

  Workaround: Install the main with standard tools.

KP-23-OB20-022 GPRslave could run into an endless loop

  Problem:    In some rare cases, GPRslave could be stuck in an endless loop
              after an interrupted build.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17 on 2015-11-25

  Workaround: Avoid interrupting distributed builds.

KP-23-OB20-001 Encapsulated libraries and external libraries

  Problem:    When building an encapsulated library importing (directly or
              indirectly) projects with a Linker_Options, the encapsulated
              library fails to build because of undefined symbols.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17 on 2015-11-22

  Workaround: Add the necessary options into the Library_Options of the
              encapsulated library.

KP-23-OB10-028 Shared libraries importing static libraries

  Problem:    When a shared library project imports an abstract project that
              itself imports static libraries, the Project Manager does not
              report an error, as it should.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17 on 2015-11-10

  Workaround: Import directly the static libraries.

KP-23-OB09-005 Crash when project path is too large

  Problem:    gprbuild crashes when the project path is too large, for example
              when environment variable GPR_PROJECT_PATH_FILE points to
              a text file with more than 33,000 characters.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17 on 2015-11-09

  Workaround: Reduce the number of directories in the project path.
