Known problems fixed in 17.1 and above
--------------------------------------

KP-23-OB20-022 GPRslave could run into an endless loop

  Problem:    In some rare cases, GPRslave could be stuck in an endless loop
              after an interrupted build.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17 on 2015-11-25

  Workaround: Avoid interrupting distributed builds.

KP-23-OB20-001 Encapsulated libraries and external libraries

  Problem:    When building an encapsulated library importing (directly or
              indirectly) projects with a Linker_Options, the encapsulated
              library fails to build because of undefined symbols.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17 on 2015-11-22

  Workaround: Add the necessary options into the Library_Options of the
              encapsulated library.

KP-23-OB10-028 Shared libraries importing static libraries

  Problem:    When a shared library project imports an abstract project that
              itself imports static libraries, the Project Manager does not
              report an error, as it should.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17 on 2015-11-10

  Workaround: Import directly the static libraries.

KP-23-OB09-005 Crash when project path is too large

  Problem:    gprbuild crashes when the project path is too large, for example
              when environment variable GPR_PROJECT_PATH_FILE points to
              a text file with more than 33,000 characters.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17 on 2015-11-09

  Workaround: Reduce the number of directories in the project path.
