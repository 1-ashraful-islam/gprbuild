The following is a listing of known problems in release 1.2.0. Except where
specifically noted, all these problems have been corrected in the development
tree of the 1.3 technology. This means they are corrected in any 1.2.0w
wavefront issued subsequent to the date specified (in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD) in
the status line. This can be used to determine if a given wavefront has the fix
identified in the entry.

KP-120-I315-004 Unneeded recompilation with externally built library project

  Problem:    If in the project tree there is an externally built library
              project with no library exchange file, gprbuild will always
              relinkl the executable.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.3.0 on 2009-03-15

  Workaround: Make sure that there is a valid library exchange file

KP-120-I302-001 Crash when library project has no object directory

  Problem:    gprbuild may crash if the object directory of a library project
              does not exist.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.3.0 on 2009-03-03

  Workaround: Create the object directory

KP-120-I216-021 --no-indirect-imports not allowed in Builder switches

  Problem:    The gprbuild switch --no-indirect-imports is not allowed
              in switches specified in package Builder. It is only allowed
              on the command line.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.3.0 on 2009-02-17

  Workaround: Use --no-indirect-imports on the command line

KP-120-I205-035 Gprbuild does not obey -o option

  Problem:    gprbuild does not always use the spoecified executable file
              name after the -o option.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.3.0 on 2009-02-06

  Workaround: Indicate the executable file name in package Binder of the
              project file.

KP-120-I119-020 Gprconfig terminates when some directories are unreadable

  Problem:    gprconfig will terminate when some directories on the PATH
              are not readable.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.3.0 on 2009-01-19

  Workaround: Remove that directory from your PATH environment variable

KP-120-HB17-004 No recompilation when ALI file created with -gnatc

  Problem:    gprbuild does not detect that an ALI file has been created
              with the switch -gnatc, so it does not systematically recompile,
              but it should.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.3.0 on 2008-11-18

  Workaround: Avoid invoking gprbuild with -gnatc, or force recompilation

KP-120-HA28-035 Crash when invoked for a spec needing completion

  Problem:    gprbuild may crash if it is invoked with a spec needing
              completion on the command line.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.3.0 on 2008-10-28

  Workaround: Avoid invoking gprbuild for a spec needing completion
