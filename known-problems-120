KP-120-I119-020 Gprconfig terminates when some directories are unreadable

  Problem:   gprconfig will terminate when some directories on the PATH
             are not readable.

  Status:    This was fixed in 1.3.0 on 2009-01-19

  Workaround: Remove that directory from your PATH environment variable


KP-120-HB17-004 No recompilation when ALI file created with -gnatc

  Problem:   gprbuild does not detect that an ALI file has been created
             with the switch -gnatc, so it does not systematically recompile,
             but it should.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.3.0 on 2008-11-18

  Workaround: Avoid invoking gprbuild with -gnatc, or force recompilation

KP-120-HA28-035 Crash when invoked for a spec needing completion

  Problem:    gprbuild may crash if it is invoked with a spec needing
              completion on the command line.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.3.0 on 2008-10-28

  Workaround: Avoid invoking gprbuild for a spec needing completion
