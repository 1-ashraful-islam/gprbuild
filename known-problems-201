KP-201-M125-039 Library version on IA64 HP-UX

  Problem:    On IA64 HP-UX, gprbuild fails to build a shared library when
              attribute Library_Version is declared.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.1 on 2013-01-25

  Workaround: Do not specify Library_Version.

KP-201-M116-027 aggregated projects sharing extended projects

  Problem:    gprbuild refuses aggregate projects where several aggregated
              project trees share a project that is extended at least once.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.1 on 2013-01-18

  Workaround: Do not aggregate projects that share an extended project.
