NF-12-H501-004 Improve backward compatibility with gnatmake (2008-05-05)

  Compatibility with projects accepted by gnatmake is improved:
    - a main may be truncated: the body suffix may be missing
    - switches from Builder'Switches (<main>) that are not recognized
      by gprbuild are for the compiler of the language of the main.

NF-12-H408-020 New attributes Object_Generated and Objects_Linked (2008-04-16)

  New attributes for languages are created: Object_Generated (when "false",
  it means that no object file is created by the "compiler") and
  Objects_Linked (when "false", it means that the object files of the
  languages are not linked in an executable or put in a library).

NF-12-H404-015 Warning when no source of a language (2008-04-05)

  When a language is declared or defaulted in a project file and there is
  no source of the language, gprbuild now issues a warning indicating this,
  unless warnings are suppressed.
