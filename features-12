NF-12-HA21-031 Support for -margs switch (2008-10-21)

  The -margs switch, equivalent to -gargs is now supported, for better
  compatibility with gnatmake.

NF-12-H821-015 Use response files when available (2008-09-22)

  When supported, and when the command line is too long, gprlib now uses
  response files to link shared libraries.

NF-12-H812-005 Support for Diab C compiler (2008-08-28)

  The Diab C compiler is now supported for powerpc-elf (using the
  ppc750 variant).

NF-12-H808-006 Specifying executable name in gprconfig (2008-08-11)

  The --config switch parameter to gprconfig can now be used to specify
  the base name of the executable you want to use. This can be used to
  easily select a type of compiler over another type, no matter whether it
  appears first in the path or not.

NF-12-H806-009 Switch files only created when -s is used (2008-09-10)

  Switch files (with the .cswi suffix) are now only created when the
  switch -s is used.

NF-12-H712-006 Partial linker to link shared libraries (2008-07-18)

  The partial linker, when declared, is now used to build shared libraries,
  in chunks if the command line length would be too long to build the
  shared library in one chunk.

NF-12-H518-002 New attribute Builder'Global_Compilation_Switches (2008-06-03)

  A new attribute Global_Compilation_Switches ("<lang>") is created in
  package Builder. This attribute is taken into account in the main project
  when attribute Default_Switches ("<lang>") is not take into account.
  The switches specified in Global_Compilation_Switches ("<lang>") are used
  when compiling a aource of language "<lang>" anywhere in the project tree.

NF-12-H501-004 Improve backward compatibility with gnatmake (2008-05-05)

  Compatibility with projects accepted by gnatmake is improved:
    - a main may be truncated: the body suffix may be missing
    - switches from Builder'Switches (<main>) that are not recognized
      by gprbuild are for the compiler of the language of the main.

NF-12-H408-020 New attributes Object_Generated and Objects_Linked (2008-04-16)

  New attributes for languages are created: Object_Generated (when "false",
  it means that no object file is created by the "compiler") and
  Objects_Linked (when "false", it means that the object files of the
  languages are not linked in an executable or put in a library).

NF-12-H404-015 Warning when no source of a language (2008-04-05)

  When a language is declared or defaulted in a project file and there is
  no source of the language, gprbuild now issues a warning indicating this,
  unless warnings are suppressed.

NF-12-H116-039 Partial linking in chunks (2008-07-18)

  When the partial linker is declared, a static stand-alone library is
  linked in chunks if the command line would be too long to link it in
  one chunk.
