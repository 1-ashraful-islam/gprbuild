-- LUA for ADA.

This is based on Lua 5.2.1.
The only differences are :
- in the src/ directory:
    * an extra lua-ext.c file has been added to the source distribution, and the src/Makefile
    modified accordingly, to expose some #DEFINE to the ADA world.
    * the dependency to the curses library has been removed from the src/Makefile
    * the Makefile builds and installs only the static library, in `gcc -dumpmachine`

- the ada/ directory contains the ada bindings.

To build the linux version:
        - make linux install
To build the windows version:
        - make mingw install
