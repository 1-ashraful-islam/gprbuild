This contains two libraries :
1) libdsdp5.8, for semidefinite programming
2) a wrapper around this library, libconeprogramming, to be used in gprime.

to build (DSDP):
$./build.sh

to build libconeprogramming:
gprbuild -Pconesolving

In practice, the wrapper should be built automatically when building gprime.
