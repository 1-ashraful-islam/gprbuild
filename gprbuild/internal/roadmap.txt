[GPRbuild 2.0.1]

- Support cleaning arbitrary intermediate artifacts in gprclean

  A new package Clean is added in project files. It can contain declarations
  of attributes Source_Artifact_Extensions and Object_Artifact_Extensions,
  that specify the extensions of files whose names are derived from source or
  object file names, that reside in the object directory and that are to be
  cleaned by gprclean.

- Automated installation of the software product defined by the project

  A new tool named gprinstall can be used to install a standard or a library
  project.

- Support for aggregate and aggregate library projects

  Aggregate and aggregate library projects are now fully implemented.

[GPRbuild 2.3.1]

- Stability and useability improvements in distributed mode

  Many subtle race conditions and malfunctions when the build farm is forcibly
  terminated have been fixed.

- Make GPR toolkit standalone and publish it to GitHub

- Update GNATCOLL.Projects and make all project-aware tools use consistent API.

- Provide gpr for runtimes

  Every runtime will come with a gpr, that would allow user to rebuild it
  (gnatmake -a replacement).
