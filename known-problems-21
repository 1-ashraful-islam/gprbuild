Known problems fixed in 2.2.1 and above
---------------------------------------

KP-21-N507-022 gprinstall fail to install executable in aggregated projects

  Problem:    If the aggregated project is not using the default executable
              name using a package Binder Executable attribute, gprinstall
              will fail.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2014-05-07

  Workaround: Install the aggregated projects separately.

KP-21-N505-036 Aggregate library directories

  Problem:    In some cases, when an aggregate library project had its
              library directory or its library ALI directory the same as the
              object directory of library directory of one of its aggregated
              projects, gprbuild is unable to build correctly the aggegate
              library.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2014-05-06

  Workaround: Avoid the situation described above.

KP-21-N429-037 gprinstall may fail to remove symbolic links

  Problem:    Uninstalling using gprinstall may leave symbolic links (created
              for shared libraries) dangling.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2014-04-30

  Workaround: Remove the file manually.

KP-21-N423-036 Installation of aggregate SAL projects

  Problem:    gprinstall does not install properly aggregate Stand-Alone
              Library projects. In particular, no ALI file is copied to
              the library ALI directory.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2014-04-25

  Workaround: Avoid installation of aggregate library projects.

KP-21-N422-033 Library exchange files of aggregate libraries

  Problem:    gprbuild creates the library exchange file of an aggregate
              library project in the project directory, which may be read-only.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2014-04-25

  Workaround: Make sure that the project directory of an aggregate library
              project is writable.

KP-21-N422-024 gprinstall fails to properly install shared SAL

  Problem:    Shared standalone libraries are not properly installed and
              cannot be used once install by gprinstall.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2014-04-22

  Workaround: install the library manually.

KP-21-N422-023 gprinstall fails to properly install static SAL

  Problem:    Static standalone libraries are not properly installed and
              cannot be used once install by gprinstall.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2014-04-22

  Workaround: install the library manually.

KP-21-N416-050 Files not properly synchronized in distributed compilation

  Problem:    Some files are not properly synchronized when using two
              directories for the same projects.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2014-04-17

  Workaround: clear the remote slave environment (using gprclean) when
              switching from one directory to another.

KP-21-N411-006 Better handle unexpected events in gprslave

  Problem:    In some cases (using old build master) gprslave could freeze
              and become unresponsive.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2014-04-12

  Workaround: do not use an old build master with recent gprslave version

KP-21-N409-006 Truncated files on distributed builds

  Problem:    If GPRbuild is killed abruptly it can happen that some truncated
              sources are left on the slave's side.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2014-04-09

  Workaround: remove all files on the slaves using GPRclean.

KP-21-N407-021 Hard killing a build master makes slaves unresponsive

  Problem:    Hard killing with ctrl-c a build master while synchronization of
              sources is in progress makes the slaves unresponsive.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2014-05-01

  Workaround: restart the remote slaves

KP-21-N407-018 Fail to clean-up remote slave with gpr protocol

  Problem:    When using the gpr protocol it is not possible to clean-up the
              remote slaves with gprclean.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2014-04-07

  Workaround: use the rsync protocol for cleaning-up the remote slaves.

KP-21-N331-007 Fail to compile large sources in distributed mode

  Problem:    When a project contains large sources or large objects
              gprbuild may fail during the compilation phase when using
              the gpr protocol.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2014-04-02

  Workaround: use the rsync distributed compilation protocol.

KP-21-N319-020 gprbuild fails with binder switch "-s"

  Problem:    When gprbuild is invoked with the binder switch "-s". the binding
              phase will fail as gnatbind is unable to find the sources.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2014-03-19

  Workaround: Do not use binder switch "-s" when using gprbuild.

KP-21-N318-025 gprinstall does not recognized -d option

  Problem:    The -d option (short version of --dry-run) is documented
              but not recognized by gprinstall.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2014-03-19

  Workaround: Uses --dry-run instead.

KP-21-N313-008 gprinstall fails with spec naming exception

  Problem:    When gprinstall is invoked to install a library project file
              that is not a Stand-Alone Library and there is a spec with
              a naming exception, the installation will fail.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2014-03-13

  Workaround: Avoid spec naming exceptions in library project file.

KP-21-N310-027 gprbuild wait indefinitely for some compilation results

  Problem:    If the Remote package Root_Dir attribute is not properly set
              gprbuild may not terminate.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2014-03-10

  Workaround: fix the Root_Dir attribute value.

KP-21-N120-075 gprclean -r and cycles in externally built projects

  Problem:    When there are several externally built projects in the project
              tree and some of them form a cycle, through limited withs,
              invoking gprclean with switch -r will result in a crash.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2014-01-21

  Workaround: Avoid circularities in externally built projects or invoke
              gprclean without switch -r.

KP-21-N103-018 Failure to link on target powerpc-xcoff-lynxos178

  Problem:    For target powerpc-xcoff-lynxos178, when there are two many
              object files to be linked, because a response file is not used,
              the linking phase may fail.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2014-01-06

  Workaround: Add these two lines in package Linker of the main project:
                for Response_File_Format use "GCC_GNU";
                for Max_Command_Line_Length use "8192";

KP-21-MB30-011 Garbled output from parallel invocations of gnatbind

  Problem:    When gprbuild is invoked with -jnn and there are several mains,
              several invocations of gprbind may be running in parallel and
              their displayed gnatbind invocations may be garbled.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2013-12-01

  Workaround: Ignore the problem or invoke gprbuild without -jnn.

KP-21-MB26-007 Dependency builder must be invoked from the object directory

  Problem:    When gprbuild performs parallel compilations and for some
              language a dependency builder is invoked to build a dependency
              file, the dependency builder may be invoked from the object
              directory of another project and thus may fail if some of its
              arguments are relative paths.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2013-11-27

  Workaround: Use absolute paths for the arguments of a dependency builder.

KP-21-MB05-034 gprinstall fails to install projects built with sub-dirs

  Problem:    gprinstall is not able to install a code which has been
              built with gprbuild's --subdirs option.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2013-11-05

  Workaround: Install the code manually.

KP-21-MA31-004 Aggregated libraries and externally built

  Problem:    gprbuild was not properly dealing with externally built
              projects on the dependencies. First it was trying to add the
              object code from such libraries and failed to pass the library
              on to the linker.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2013-11-01

  Workaround: Remove the externally built projects from the dependencies if
              possible and pass the corresponding library to the linker.

KP-21-MA30-041 Aggregated libraries and gprinstall

  Problem:    gprinstall was not properly handling aggregate libraries. The
              installation was failing and/or the generated project was not
              usable.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2013-11-02

  Workaround: Install the software using a script.

Known problems fixed in 2.1.2 and above
---------------------------------------

KP-21-N421-002 Failing installing artifacts with gprinstall

  Problem:    When installing a static and relocatable build of the same
              libraries for a library project having some artifacts,
              gprinstall complains that the artifacts are already installed.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2014-04-21
              This was fixed in 2.1.2 on 2014-05-14

  Workaround: force installation for the second gprinstall call using -f

KP-21-N207-022 Fail to compile sources in distributed mode

  Problem:    Top level sources (sources found at the project's root
              directory) will fail to compile on remote compilation slaves.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.1.2 on 2014-02-07

  Workaround: do not use the distributed compilation mode

KP-21-N206-041 wrong permissions set by gprinstall for binaries

  Problem:    On UNIX, a binary installed with gprinstall will have the
              executable permission set only for the owner. This will prevent
              others to execute this binary. It is a problem when installing
              an application in a shared computer for example.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2014-02-06
              This was fixed in 2.1.2 on 2014-05-14

  Workaround: change the permissions manually using chmod

Known problems fixed in 2.1.1 and above
---------------------------------------

KP-21-MB06-054 gprinstall and shared library with version on windows

  Problem:    On Windows, gprinstall fails while installing a shared library
              project when the attribute Library_Version is defined.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2013-11-06
              This was fixed in 2.1.1 on 2013-11-27

  Workaround: Manually install the library.

KP-21-MB06-015 gprinstall and standalone libraries

  Problem:    gprinstall does not generate a usable project file for
              standalone libraries.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2013-11-06
              This was fixed in 2.1.1 on 2013-11-27

  Workaround: Manually adds the Library_Interface and Library_Standalone
              attributes.

KP-21-MB05-020 gprconfig does not detect non GNAT gcc C and g++ compilers

  Problem:    gprconfig does not find all non GNAT gcc C and g++ compilers.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.2 on 2013-11-07
              This was fixed in 2.1.1 on 2013-12-10

  Workaround: Manually edit a configuration project file and use it with
              gprbuild.
