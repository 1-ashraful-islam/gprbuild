The following is a listing of known problems in release 1.0.0. Except where
specifically noted, all these problems have been corrected in the development
tree of the 1.1 technology. This means they are corrected in any 1.1.0w
wavefront issued subsequent to the date specified (in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD) in
the status line. This can be used to determine if a given wavefront has the fix
identified in the entry.

KP-100-H115-007 gprbuild fails to build archives with many object files

  Problem:    gprbuild may fail to build archives (for static library or the
              global archive) when the number of object files is too large.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.1.0 on 2008-01-16

  Workaround: Either reduce the number of object files, using one or
              several static libraries, or reduce the absolute paths of
              the project files.

KP-100-H124-002 Missing objects from externally built projects

  Problem:    When an externally built projects does not contain sources
              for bodies, but only for some specs, some of the object files
              may be missing in the global archive.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.1.0 on 2008-03-06

  Workaround: Convert the externally built project into an externally
              built static library project.

KP-100-H208-029 -bargs and -largs not allowed in package Builder

  Problem:    Switches -bargs, -bargs:<lang> and -largs are not accepted
              in the switch attributes of package Builder.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.1.0 on 2008-02-09

  Workaround: Use these switches only on the command line.

KP-100-H216-002 gprbuild crashes with limited with cycle

  Problem:    gprbuild may crash if there are cycles in the project tree
              using limited withs.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.1.0 on 2008-02-17

  Workaround: Do not use limited withs.

KP-100-H226-027 Missing gprclean switch -eL

  Problem:    The switch -eL, to follow symbolic links when processing
              project files, is missing for gprclean.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.1.0 on 2008-02-26

  Workaround: Do not use symbolic links.

KP-100-H303-021 Linker switches not relative to project directory

  Problem:    When using switches in package Linker that include relative
              paths, the paths are relative to the object directory, not to
              the project directory as is done for gnatmake.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.1.0 on 2008-03-04

  Workaround: Use only absolute paths.

KP-100-H218-008 Wrong executable name generated

  Problem:    When the body suffix of the main includes several dots,
              gprbuild does not generate the proper executable name.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.1.0 on 2008-02-18

  Workaround: Specify the executable name in the project file.

KP-100-GC29-007 Importing an externally buit library with an empty object dir

  Problem:    Building a Stand-Alone Library that imports an externally built
              library where the object directory does not contain any ALI file
              fails.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.1.0 on 2007-12-29

  Workaround: Copy the ALI files in the object directory.

KP-100-GC29-003 SALs with capital letter names on Windows

  Problem:    Stand-Alone Libraries with capital letters in their names are
              not build correctly on Windows.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.1.0 on 2007-12-29

  Workaround: Use only library names with small letters.

KP-100-GC12-012 Failure to build a library that imports other libraries

  Problem:    When a library project imports several other library projects,
              gprbuild will fail to build the library.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.1.0 on 2007-12-16

  Workaround: Reduce the number of libraries.

KP-100-GC12-009 Autoconfiguration fails when object dir not present

  Problem:    When the object dir of the main project file is not present
              autoconfiguration fails, even when gprbuild is called with -p.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.1.0 on 2007-12-18

  Workaround: Create manually the object dir of the main project.
