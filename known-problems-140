KP-140-IA29-033 Library built with different symbolic links

  Problem:    When a library has been built in a setup where there are
              symbolic links and it is part of another setup with different
              or no symbolic links, gprbuild always attempts to rebuild
              the library.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.5.0 on 2009-11-04

  Workaround: Always invoke gprbuild with -eL.

KP-140-IA27-015 Static library built in chunks contains duplicate object files

  Problem:    When static libraries (archives) are built in chunks and are
              rebuilt, they may contains duplicate object files, including
              old object files that should have been replaced.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.5.0 on 2009-10-27

  Workaround: Delete the archive before rebuilding it.

KP-140-I925-022 No language detected when extending a project with no languages

  Problem:    A project that extends another project with no languages may
              not have a default language, as no languages were found during
              auto configuration.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.5.0 on 2009-10-23

  Workaround: Declare the Ada language in the extending project.
