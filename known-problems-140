The following is a listing of known problems in release 1.4.0. All these
problems have been corrected in the release 1.4.1 and in any wavefront

KP-140-IC10-043 No switches file created when -s in Builder switches

  Problem:    When gprbuild switch -s is specified in the Builder switches of
              the main project, but not on the command line, no switches fie
              is created, resulting in recompilation of all sources each time
              gprbuild is invoked.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.5.0 on 2009-12-10

  Workaround: Specify -s on the command line.

KP-140-IC09-017 Bad compilation options

  Problem:    When there are empty compilation options, these options are
              replaced by random values, which may lead to compilation errors.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.5.0 on 2009-12-09

  Workaround: Avoid empty compilation options

KP-140-IC03-003 gprbind cannot bind with Binder option -C

  Problem:    When there is an option -C in the Binder package, the binding
              of Ada executables fail.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.5.0 on 2009-12-03

  Workaround: Do not specify Binder option -C.

KP-140-IC02-002 Library not rebuilt when source is recompiled

  Problem:    When in a library project a modified source is recompiled, the
              library is not always rebuilt.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.5.0 on 2009-12-02

  Workaround: Invoke gprbuild twice: the library will be rebuilt for the second
              invocation.

KP-140-IA29-033 Library built with different symbolic links

  Problem:    When a library has been built in a setup where there are
              symbolic links and it is part of another setup with different
              or no symbolic links, gprbuild always attempts to rebuild
              the library.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.5.0 on 2009-11-04

  Workaround: Always invoke gprbuild with -eL.

KP-140-IA27-015 Static library built in chunks contains duplicate object files

  Problem:    When static libraries (archives) are built in chunks and are
              rebuilt, they may contains duplicate object files, including
              old object files that should have been replaced.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.5.0 on 2009-10-27

  Workaround: Delete the archive before rebuilding it.
