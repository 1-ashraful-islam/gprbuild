The following is a listing of known problems in release 1.4.0. Except where
specifically noted, all these problems have been corrected in the development
tree of the 1.5 technology. This means they are corrected in any 1.4.0w
wavefront issued subsequent to the date specified (in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD) in
the status line. This can be used to determine if a given wavefront has the fix
identified in the entry.

KP-140-J107-023 Extending project and --no-indirect-imports

  Problem:   gprbuild fails to compile a source in a project being extended
             that imports from the extending project when invoked with
             --no-indirect-imports.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.5.0 on 2010-01-07

  Workaround: Invoke gprbuild without --no-indirect-imports.

KP-140-IC10-043 No switches file created when -s in Builder switches

  Problem:    When gprbuild switch -s is specified in the Builder switches of
              the main project, but not on the command line, no switches fie
              is created, resulting in recompilation of all sources each time
              gprbuild is invoked.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.5.0 on 2009-12-10

  Workaround: Specify -s on the command line.

KP-140-IC09-017 Bad compilation options

  Problem:    When there are empty compilation options, these options are
              replaced by random values, which may lead to compilation errors.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.5.0 on 2009-12-09

  Workaround: Avoid empty compilation options

KP-140-IC03-003 gprbind cannot bind with Binder option -C

  Problem:    When there is an option -C in the Binder package, the binding
              of Ada executables fail.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.5.0 on 2009-12-03

  Workaround: Do not specify Binder option -C.

KP-140-IC02-002 Library not rebuilt when source is recompiled

  Problem:    When in a library project a modified source is recompiled, the
              library is not always rebuilt.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.5.0 on 2009-12-02

  Workaround: Invoke gprbuild twice: the library will be rebuilt for the second
              invocation.

KP-140-IB16-009 Language configuration redefined in extending project

  Problem:    When the compiler of a language is defined as non existent and
              an existing driver is declared in an extending project, the
              the sources of the original project are not compiled.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.5.0 on 2009-11-25

  Workaround: Avoid declaring non existent compiler if the project is extended.

KP-140-IA29-033 Library built with different symbolic links

  Problem:    When a library has been built in a setup where there are
              symbolic links and it is part of another setup with different
              or no symbolic links, gprbuild always attempts to rebuild
              the library.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.5.0 on 2009-11-04

  Workaround: Always invoke gprbuild with -eL.

KP-140-IA27-015 Static library built in chunks contains duplicate object files

  Problem:    When static libraries (archives) are built in chunks and are
              rebuilt, they may contains duplicate object files, including
              old object files that should have been replaced.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.5.0 on 2009-10-27

  Workaround: Delete the archive before rebuilding it.

KP-140-I925-022 No language detected when extending a project with no languages

  Problem:    A project that extends another project with no languages may
              not have a default language, as no languages were found during
              auto configuration.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.5.0 on 2009-10-23

  Workaround: Declare the Ada language in the extending project.
