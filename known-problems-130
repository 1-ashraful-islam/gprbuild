KP-130-I722-017 Systematic binding and linking when using extending projects

  Problem:   If you are using extending projects, gprbuild will systematically
             bind and link your application, even when everything is up to
             date.

  Status:    This was fixed in 1.4.0 on 2009-07-21

  Workaround: The compilation still performs correctly, and is just a bit
             slower

KP-130-I713-011 gprclean does not remove binder files

  Problem:    When the main unit's name is less than 3 characters long,
              gprclean does not remove the binder generated files (b__*.ads,
              b__*.adb and *.bexch files)

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.4.0 on 2009-07-13

  Workaround: Remove the files manually.

KLP-130-I525-017 gprbuild incompatible with option -r of gnatbind

  Problem:    When a binder option such as -r that adds output to the
              invocation of gnatbind is used, linking fails.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.4.0 on 2009-08-12

  Workaround: Remove binder option -r
