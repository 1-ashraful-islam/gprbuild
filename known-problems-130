KP-130-I828-007 Crash when using attribute Included_Switches

  Problem:    When there are several languages in a project files and for
              one of these languages attribute Included_Switches is declared,
              gprbuild may crash.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.4.0 on 2009-07-29

  Workaround: Use one project file for each language

KP-130-I722-017 Systematic binding and linking when using extending projects

  Problem:    If you are using extending projects, gprbuild will systematically
              bind and link your application, even when everything is up to
              date.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.4.0 on 2009-07-21

  Workaround: The compilation still performs correctly, and is just a bit
              slower

KP-130-I713-011 gprclean does not remove binder files

  Problem:    When the main unit's name is less than 3 characters long,
              gprclean does not remove the binder generated files (b__*.ads,
              b__*.adb and *.bexch files)

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.4.0 on 2009-07-13

  Workaround: Remove the files manually.

KP-130-I525-017 gprbuild incompatible with option -r of gnatbind

  Problem:    When a binder option such as -r that adds output to the
              invocation of gnatbind is used, linking fails.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.4.0 on 2009-08-12

  Workaround: Remove binder option -r

KP-130-I507-019 Spec not compiled when body has been excluded

  Problem:    When the body of a spec has been locally removed, the spec that
              does not need a completion is not compiled.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.4.0 on 2009-05-19

  Workaround: Use a spec with a dummy completion and a dummy body

KP-130-I505-015 Extending library project not built

  Problem:    When gprbuild is invoked for a library project that extends
              another one, the library may not be built.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.4.0 on 2009-05-06

  Workaround: Use only non extending library projects
