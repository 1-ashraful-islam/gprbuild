KP-152-K711-032 Failure to build archive on Windows

  Problem:    On Windows, gprbuild may fail to build an archive if the
              length of the command line is greater than 8192.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.6.0 on 2011-07-22

  Workaround: Reduce the length of the object path names to reduce the
              length of the command line.
