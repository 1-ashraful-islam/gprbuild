KP-161-L215-032 Remove duplicate stack size option on Windows

  Problem:    On Windows, a stack size option such as "-XLinker --stack="
              in the linker switches in the project file or on the command line
              is not taken into account.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.7 on 2012-02-16

  Workaround: Make sure that the default stack size option is sufficient
              for the execution of the program.
