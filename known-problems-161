Copyright (C) 2012, AdaCore

The following is a listing of known problems in release 1.6.1. Except where
specifically noted, all these problems have been corrected in the development
tree of the 1.7 technology. This means they are corrected in any 1.7.0w
wavefront issued subsequent to the date specified (in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD) in
the status line. This can be used to determine if a given wavefront has the fix
identified in the entry.

KP-161-L321-006 Extra recompilation when using gprbuild -s -m

  Problem:    When using both of these switches, and you change the timestamp
              (or the comments, but not the code) of a source file, gprbuild
              will still recompile the source because the file that contains
              the list of switches is older than the source now.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.7 on 2012-03-21

  Workaround: Use only -m.

KP-161-L315-021 gprbuild --no-object-check and main in project file

  Problem:    When gprbuild is called with --no-object-check and no main on
              the command line, and there is one or several mains specified in
              the project file, all sources of the project files were compiled
              instead of just the closure of the mains.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.7 on 2012-03-16

  Workaround: Call gprbuild with a main on the command line.

KP-161-L215-032 Remove duplicate stack size option on Windows

  Problem:    On Windows, a stack size option such as "-XLinker --stack="
              in the linker switches in the project file or on the command line
              is not taken into account.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.7 on 2012-02-16

  Workaround: Make sure that the default stack size option is sufficient
              for the execution of the program.

KP-161-KC01-033 gprconfig: duplicate runtimes detected on Windows

  Problem:    On Windows, gprconfig will sometimes report the "default" runtime
              multiple times for a given Ada compiler.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.7 on 2012-03-28

  Workaround: Selecting any of the lines has the same effect.
