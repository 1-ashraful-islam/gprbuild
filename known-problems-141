The following is a listing of known problems in release 1.4.1. Except where
specifically noted, all these problems have been corrected in the development
tree of the 1.5 technology. This means they are corrected in any wavefront
issued subsequent to the date specified (in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD) in the
status line. This can be used to determine if a given wavefront has the fix
identified in the entry.

KP-140-J301-025 Builder switch -p passed to the compiler

  Problem:    When gprbuild find the switch -p in package Builder of the
              main project, it invoke the compiler with this switch.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.5.0 on 2010-03-02

  Workaround: Remove switch -p from package Builder.

KP-140-J107-023 Extending project and --no-indirect-imports

  Problem:    gprbuild fails to compile a source in a project being extended
              that imports from the extending project when invoked with
              --no-indirect-imports.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.5.0 on 2010-01-07

  Workaround: Invoke gprbuild without --no-indirect-imports.

KP-140-IB16-009 Language configuration redefined in extending project

  Problem:    When the compiler of a language is defined as non existent and
              an existing driver is declared in an extending project, the
              the sources of the original project are not compiled.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.5.0 on 2009-11-25

  Workaround: Avoid declaring non existent compiler if the project is extended.

KP-140-I925-022 No language detected when extending a project with no languages

  Problem:    A project that extends another project with no languages may
              not have a default language, as no languages were found during
              auto configuration.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.5.0 on 2009-10-23

  Workaround: Declare the Ada language in the extending project.
