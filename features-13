This file contains a complete list of new features in version 1.3 of GPRBUILD.
A full description of all GPRBUILD features can be found in the GPRBUILD
User's Guide.

An ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) appears in parentheses after the description line.
This date shows the implementation date of the feature. Any 1.3.0w
wavefront subsequent to this date will contain the indicated feature, as
will any subsequent releases.

NF-13-I330-024 New gprbind switch --gnatbind_path= (2009-04-01)

  A new switch --gnatbind_path= is introduced, so that the proper gnatbind
  can be specified by the user, when it is not the one at the same location
  as the Ada compiler. In addition, when this switch is not specified and
  gnatbind is not found at the same location as the Ada compiler, gprbind
  now looks for gnatbind on the path.

NF-13-HC19-013 New switch --unchecked-shared-lib-imports (2009-01-16)

  A new gprbuild/gprclean switch --unchecked-shared-lib-imports is created.
  When this switch is used (on the command line only), shared library
  projects are not restricted to import only other shared library projects.

NF-13-HB21-029 Detect incorrect targets (2008-11-25)

  Switch --target= can now be used with --config= or --autoconf=. The name
  of the target, if any, is stored in the configuration project file and
  gprbuild checks target consistency. If there is a target inconsistency,
  gprbuild fails if --config= is used or it performs autoconfiguration if
  --autoconf= is used.

NF-13-HA14-001 New gnatmake compatibility switches (2008-10-24)

  New builder switches to increase compatibility with gnatmake have been
  added: -nostdlib, -nostdinc, -fstack-check, -fno-inline, -g*, -O* and -eS.
  These switches are accepted on the command line and in the Builder switches
  when the language is Ada.
