NF-13-HB21-029 Detect incorrect targets (2008-11-25)

  Switch --target= can now be used with --config= or --autoconf=. The name
  of the target, if any, is stored in the configuration project file and
  gprbuild checks target consistency. If there is a target inconsistency,
  gprbuild fails if --config= is used or it performs autoconfiguration if
  --autoconf= is used.

NF-13-HA14-001 New gnatmake compatibility switches (2008-10-24)

  New builder switches to increase compatibility with gnatmake have been
  added: -nostdlib, -nostdinc, -fstack-check, -fno-inline, -g*, -O* and -eS.
  These switches are accepted on the command line and in the Builder switches
  when the language is Ada.
