Known problems fixed in 2.3.1 and above
---------------------------------------

KP-22-NC05-016 References from incomplete withs

  Problem:    When a project file references an attribute, a variable or
              a package from an imported project that has not yet be found
              before the project search path has been updated, an error is
              reported and no processing is done by gprbuild.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.3 on 2014-12-08

  Workaround: Set the project search path so that the imported project will be
              found, before invoking gprbuild.

KP-22-NA16-016 aggregate project, extended projects and sources not compiled

  Problem:    When an aggregate project aggregated two project trees and the
              same project is in both tree and is extended in at least one of
              the two trees, immediate sources of the project may not be
              properly compiled in both trees.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.3 on 2014-11-25

  Workaround: Invoke gprbuild on the two different project trees.
