Known problems fixed in 2.3.1 and above
---------------------------------------

KP-22-NB04-012 aggregate project and illegal source compiled several times

  Problem:    When gprbuild is invoked with -jnn on a main aggregate project,
              and the same illegal source in different projects in different
              project trees needs to be compiled, gprbuild may crash.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.3 on 2014-11-04

  Workaround: Invoke gprbuild without -jnnn.

KP-22-NA16-016 aggregate project, extended projects and sources not compiled

  Problem:    When an aggregate project aggregated two project trees and the
              same project is in both tree and is extended in at least one of
              the two trees, immediate sources of the project may not be
              properly compiled in both trees.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.3 on 2014-11-25

  Workaround: Invoke gprbuild on the two different project trees.
