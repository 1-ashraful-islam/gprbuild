The following is a listing of known problems in releases 2.2.1 and 2.2.2.
Each entry contains a status line stating when the problem was fixed, and on
which release(s). In addition, any wavefront issued subsequent to the date
specified (in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD) also contains the fix. This can be used
to determine if a given release or wavefront has the fix identified in the
entry.

Note that older releases might or might not be affected by the problems listed
in this document.

Known problems fixed in 2.3.1 and above
---------------------------------------

KP-22-O302-010 gprbuild distributed won't exit after ctrl-c

  Problem:    When interrupting a distributed build with a ctrl-c signal,
              gprbuild may not exit and freeze.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.3 on 2015-03-19

  Workaround: Do not interrupt the build or do not build in distributed mode.

KP-22-O129-033 gprclean does not always remove .lexch file

  Problem:    On Windows and Darwin, when the name of a shared library
              includes uppercase letter, gprclean does not delete the library
              exchange file (.lexch).

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.3 on 2015-01-29

  Workaround: Delete manually the .lexch file.

KP-22-O122-017 Reference to variable in missing predefined project

  Problem:    When a project imports a predefined project and refers to a
              variable in this imported project, gprbuild may fail before
              being able to update the project path and finding the predefined
              project during its second parsing.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.3 on 2015-01-22

  Workaround: Put the directory of the predefined project in GPR_PROJECT_PATH.

KP-22-O116-019 Reference to missing predefined imported project

  Problem:    When a project imports a predefined project and refers to this
              imported project, gprbuild may fail before being able to
              update the project path and finding the predefined project
              during its second parsing.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.3 on 2015-01-19

  Workaround: Put the directory of the predefined project in GPR_PROJECT_PATH.

KP-22-O113-051 Wrong configuration project file with gprconfig interactive

  Problem:    When gprconfig is invoked interactively and there are several
              runtimes with XML files for compilers on the path, all these
              XML files are taken into account and the resulting configuration
              project file may be incorrect or even illegal.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.3 on 2015-01-14

  Workaround: Invoke gprconfig in batch mode.

KP-22-O107-015 Freeze of GPRbuild in distributed mode.

  Problem:    After hard-killing a GPRbuild distributed compilation it
              may happen that the GPRslave is not properly notified and
              does not release the client. This in turn make it impossible
              for the same client to connect to the slave.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.3 on 2015-01-11

  Workaround: Do not hard-kill (ctrl-c) a GPRbuild distributed compilation.

KP-22-NC17-037 No warnings in project files if no errors

  Problem:    When gprbuild is invoked without -q and there are warnings
              during parsing of the project files, but no errors, the
              warnings are not displayed.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.3 on 2014-12-17

  Workaround: None needed, as there is no error here, just a display problem.

KP-22-NC10-018 GPRbuild distributed recompile all sources

  Problem:    When a project is using a global configuration pragmas file
              (using -gnatec option or with Global_Configuration_Pragmas
              project's attribute) GPRbuild in distributed mode will always
              recompile all sources

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.3 on 2014-12-11

  Workaround: Do not use the distributed compilation mode for such projects.

KP-22-NC05-016 References from incomplete withs

  Problem:    When a project file references an attribute, a variable or
              a package from an imported project that has not yet be found
              before the project search path has been updated, an error is
              reported and no processing is done by gprbuild.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.3 on 2014-12-08

  Workaround: Set the project search path so that the imported project will be
              found, before invoking gprbuild.

KP-22-NA16-016 aggregate project, extended projects and sources not compiled

  Problem:    When an aggregate project aggregated two project trees and the
              same project is in both tree and is extended in at least one of
              the two trees, immediate sources of the project may not be
              properly compiled in both trees.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.3 on 2014-11-25

  Workaround: Invoke gprbuild on the two different project trees.
