The following is a listing of known problems in release 1.6.0. Except where
specifically noted, all these problems have been corrected in the development
tree of the 1.7 technology. This means they are corrected in any 1.7.0w
wavefront issued subsequent to the date specified (in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD) in
the status line. This can be used to determine if a given wavefront has the fix
identified in the entry.

KP-160-K917-002 Ignore compilers when variables cannot be computed

  Problem:    In gprconfig, if a compiler description includes the computation
              of extra variables (like "gcc_version" for GNAT) and this
              variable cannot be computed, the compiler should simply be
              ignored. Instead, gprconfig stops working. In particular,
              gprconfig failed if a .NET compiler for Ada was installed on the
              machine.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.7.0 on 2011-10-24

  Workaround: Use the command line switches to specify the compilers to use,
              rather than let gprconfig auto-detect them.
