NF-1x-H808-006 Specifying executable name in gprconfig (2008-08-11)

  The --config switch parameter to gprconfig can now be used to specify
  the base name of the executable you want to use. This can be used to
  easily select a type of compiler over another type, no matter whether it
  appears first in the path or not.
