Copyright (C) 2015-2016, AdaCore

This file contains a complete list of new features in version 17 of GPRBUILD.
A full description of all GPRBUILD features can be found in the GPRBUILD
User's Guide.

NF-17-P525-069 Setting the default verbosity (2016-05-26)

   It is now possible to control the default verbosity without to use switches
   -v or -q, with environment variable GPR_VERBOSITY. The possible values,
   case-insensitive, are "quiet", "default", "verbose", "verbose_high",
   "verbose_medium" and "verbose_low". Any other value is ignored.

NF-17-P524-040 Runtimes with multiple directories (2016-05-26)

   Runtimes with multiple directories for sources or object/libraries are
   now properly supported.

NF-17-P519-041 Runtime (<lang>) as a relative path (2016-05-25)

   It is now possible to specify a runtime directory with the attribute
   Runtime as a relative path, in the main project. Example:
      for Runtime ("Ada") use "./rts";
   The path is relative to the project directory of the main project.

NF-17-P215-047 GPRbuild supports response files during compilation (2016-03-10)

   GPRbuild, when the language is configured appropriately and the compilation
   command line is long, will invoke the compiler with a response file. This
   will avoid problems on platforms where the maximum length of the command
   line or of the value of an environment variable is not very high.

NF-17-P208-011 GPRbuild encapsulated libraries on all linux (2016-02-08)

   Now GPRbuild supports encapsulated libraries for all linux platforms
   when using a recent GNAT Pro compiler.

NF-17-P204-001 GPRinstall minimal installation enhancement (2016-02-16)

   Now GPRinstall running in minimal installation mode won't install a
   body even if a specific naming scheme is defined.

NF-17-P116-001 GPRbuild distributed slave error messages (2016-01-20)

   Now GPRbuild gives a clearer error messages when it cannot connect
   to a specific slave. The slave machine is given in the error message.

NF-17-P115-020 GPRslave can now be pinged (2016-01-18)

   Now GPRslave will respond to a ping command and returns some information
   (version, UTC time, hash) about the slave if running. This can be used
   by application for checking available slaves.

NF-17-P114-005 Temporary config project with autoconfiguration (2016-04-13)

   The Project Manager now creates a temporary configuration project file
   when in auto-configuration. This file is deleted when the tool terminates.
   This allows several project-aware tools invocations to work in parallel
   with the same object directory.

NF-17-P112-018 GPRbuild distributed ignore Mercurial metadata (2016-01-12)

   The Mercurial metadata directory has been added into the excluded
   patterns by default.

NF-17-P112-012 GPRbuild distributed environment consistency (2016-01-18)

   A new option (--hash) has been added in GPRbuild and GPRslave. The
   value specified can be used to ensure that the environement is consistent
   on both side.

NF-17-OC08-018 New attribute Origin_Project (2016-04-05)

   A new project level attribute Origin_Project is defined. Its value is
   a single string and designates a project name. It may be used for
   various purposes by project aware tools.

NF-17-OC01-014 New Library_Kind "static-pic" (2015-12-02)

   A new library kind "static-pic" is introduced. static-pic libraries are
   static libraries, but their code is compiled with the PIC option, if it
   exists.

NF-17-OB06-018 Add progress indication on the GPRslave (2015-11-08)

   GPRslave will now display (in verbose mode) a progress indicator during
   the synchronization and the compilation.

NF-17-OB03-010 Incomplete Ada interface of SAL is now an error (2015-11-07)

   When the Ada interface of a Stand-Alone Library project is incomplete,
   gprbuild now reports an error instead of a warning.

NF-17-O916-065 Path names of duplicate unit sources (2015-12-05)

   In verbose mode,  when a duplicate unit is found in two sources, the path
   names of the two sources are now output.

NF-17-O331-015 GPRbuild now restrict symbols from a SAL (2015-10-31)

   GPRbuild now restricts the symbols exported out of a SAL. The exported
   symbols are those part of the SAL's interface as specified by the
   Library_Interface or Interfaces attributes.

NF-17-N512-051 New procedure Get_Closures (2016-04-01)

   A new procedure GPR.Util.Get_Closures is added. It allows to get the
   full paths of the sources in the Ada closures of one or several mains.
