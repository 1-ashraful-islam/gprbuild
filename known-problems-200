KP-200-M104-032 Modified library in externally built library project

  Problem:    When the library file of an externally built library project
              is modified, executables that depend on this library are not
              always relinked.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.1.0 on 2012-01-07

  Workaround: Force recompilation of the executables.
