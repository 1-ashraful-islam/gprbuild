Known problems in GPRBUILD version 2.0.1
========================================

Copyright (C) 2013, AdaCore

The following is a listing of known problems in release 2.0.1. Except where
specifically noted, all these problems have been corrected in the development
tree of the 2.1 technology. This means they are corrected in any 2.1.0w
wavefront issued subsequent to the date specified (in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD) in
the status line. This can be used to determine if a given wavefront has the fix
identified in the entry.

KP-202-M625-043 Minimal recompilation and preprocessed sources

  Problem:    When gprbuild is invoked with -m (minimal recompilation) and
              a source that need preprocessing is checked for its checksum
              to decide if it needs to be recompiled, gprbuild may behave
              incorrectly, either reporting "preprocessor not active" errors
              or even crashing.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.1 on 2013-06-26

  Workaround: Invoke gprbuild without switch -m.

KP-202-M417-023 Deeply extended library projects

  Problem:    When a library A project extends a project B that itself extends
              a project C, object files for sources that are not immediate
              sources of projects A or B are not included in the library file.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.1 on 2013-04-17

  Workaround: Do not extend an already extending library project.

KP-202-M116-027 aggregated projects sharing extended projects

  Problem:    gprbuild refuses aggregate projects where several aggregated
              project trees share a project that is extended at least once.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.1 on 2013-01-18

  Workaround: Do not aggregate projects that share an extended project.

KP-202-KC15-051 gprconfig should not parse twice the same knowledge base

  Problem:    gprconfig, in some circumstances, may parse several times the
              same knowledge base directory. This may result in an invalid
              configuration project file, for example the same string type
              may be declared several times.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.1 on 2013-02-04

  Workaround: Avoid parsing several times the same knowledge base directory.
