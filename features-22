==============================

Copyright (C) 2013-2014, AdaCore

This file contains a complete list of new features in version 2.2 of GPRBUILD.
A full description of all GPRBUILD features can be found in the GPRBUILD
User's Guide.

NF-22-N206-046 No usage for gpr tools incorrectly invoked (2014-02-10)

  When a gpr tool (gprbuild, gprconfig, gprclean or gprinstall) is incorrectly
  invoked, with at least one argument, the usage will no longer be displayed.
  Instead this line will be displayed:
     type `gprxxx --help` for more information.

NF-22-N130-015 Check distributed build consistency (2014-02-03)

  A check is now done to ensure that build slaves, used on a distributed
  compilation farm, are all of the same version as the build master.

NF-22-N121-005 Check for clock drift in distributed mode (2014-01-29)

  A clock check is done between the slaves and the build master before
  starting a distributed compilation. A warning is issued if a clock drift
  is detected. It is important to have the clock properly synchronized to
  avoid unneeded recompilation.

NF-22-N108-032 Add support for grouping installs with gprinstall (2014-01-22)

  A new option named --install-name can be used to group installations
  under a single name. It makes it possible to uninstall with a single
  command the multiple installations. This can be handy when a library
  comes with some tools for example, both built with different projects files.
  Yet, the library and the executables are tightly related and part of the
  same application.
