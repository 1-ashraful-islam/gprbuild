NF-22-N108-032 Add support for grouping installs with gprinstall (2014-01-22)

  A new option named --install-name can be used to group installations
  under a single name. It makes it possible to uninstall with a single
  command the multiple installations. This can be handy when a library
  comes with some tools for example, both built with different projects files.
  Yet, the library and the executables are tightly related and part of the
  same application.
