GPRBUILD 2.2 NEW FEATURES LIST
==============================

Copyright (C) 2013-2014, AdaCore

This file contains a complete list of new features in version 2.2 of GPRBUILD.
A full description of all GPRBUILD features can be found in the GPRBUILD
User's Guide.

NF-22-N812-027 --target and CodePeer mode (2014-08-20)

  When gprbuild is called with switches --codepeer and --target, it now
  issues a clear error message indicating that these two switches cannot be
  used simultaneously, instead of hard to understand errors such as:
      no languages defined for this project

NF-22-N717-033 Switch -a accepted with a warning (2014-07-17)

  To ease migration from gnatmake to gprbuild, switch -a is now accepted by
  gprbuild. However, this switch has no other effect than to issue this
  warning:
     warning: switch -a is ignored and no additional source is compiled

NF-22-N704-034 Add build master id in log message (2014-07-05)

  A unique id in front of all log messages is now output by gprslave.
  This make it is easier to find all log for a specific build.

NF-22-N704-033 Better reactivity for gprslave (2014-08-02)

  The locking circuitry of gprslave has been rewritten completely to ensure
  better responsiveness to multiple requests. For example, now a gprclean
  distributed request won't have to wait the end of compilations.

NF-22-N626-040 Randomized distributed job dispatching (2014-07-11)

  Now gprbuild in distributed mode will select slaves randomly instead of
  picking the first with some compilation slots available. This will better
  distribute the load over all the slaves.

NF-22-N505-024 Handles Library_Options in gprinstall (2014-05-07)

  When generating a project for a library (standard or aggregate), gprinstall
  now adds into the generated Linker_Options the options that were into
  the Library_Options.

NF-22-N418-025 New gprinstall option to copy only project sources (2014-04-19)

  Using gprinstall's --sources-only option it is now possible to install
  projects sources only. In this mode it is not required for the project to
  have been built before.

NF-22-N411-007 Add a time-stamp in all gprslave's message (2014-04-12)

  All gprslave's messages are now prefixed with a time-stamp in verbose mode.
  This will help tracking down possible issues with the slave.

NF-22-N402-028 Short message when main library project up to date (2014-04-02)

  When the main project is a library project and is up to date, gprbuild
  instead of running silently now displays a short message such as:
     "libmain.a" up to date
     "libmain.so" up to date

NF-22-N321-014 Add support for LLVM C compiler (2014-03-21)

  This adds support for compiling and linking with the LLVM C compiler (clang).

NF-22-N310-033 Display slaves name for remote compilation errors (2014-03-15)

  When a remote compilation fails we now display on which remote computer
  this compilation was conducted. This can helps finding remote computers
  with incorrect setup for example.

NF-22-N206-046 Advice to use --help for incorrectly invoked tools (2014-02-10)

  When a gpr tool (gprbuild, gprconfig, gprclean or gprinstall) is incorrectly
  invoked, with at least one argument, the usage will no longer be displayed.
  Instead this line will be displayed:
     type "gprxxx --help" for more information.

NF-22-N130-015 Check distributed build consistency (2014-02-03)

  A check is now done to ensure that build slaves, used on a distributed
  compilation farm, are all of the same version as the build master.

NF-22-N121-005 Check for clock drift in distributed mode (2014-01-29)

  A clock check is done between the slaves and the build master before
  starting a distributed compilation. A warning is issued if a clock drift
  is detected. It is important to have the clock properly synchronized to
  avoid unneeded recompilation.

NF-22-N115-029 GPRinstall supports listing of installed packages (2014-03-13)

  A new mode, enabled with the option --list, can be used in GPRinstall to
  display the installed packages. Used with --stat a set of statistics are
  also displayed like the number of installed files and the total size on disk.

NF-22-N108-032 Add support for grouping installs with gprinstall (2014-01-22)

  A new option named --install-name can be used to group installations
  under a single name. It makes it possible to uninstall with a single
  command the multiple installations. This can be handy when a library
  comes with some tools for example, both built with different projects files.
  Yet, the library and the executables are tightly related and part of the
  same application.

NF-22-K929-003 Limit SAL content to the closure of the interface (2014-04-29)

  When using gprbuild to build a Stand-Alone Library, only the closure of the
  Ada interface is compiled, bound and put in the library file.
