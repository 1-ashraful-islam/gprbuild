This file contains a complete list of new features in version 1.4 of GPRBUILD.
A full description of all GPRBUILD features can be found in the GPRBUILD
User's Guide.

An ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) appears in parentheses after the description line.
This date shows the implementation date of the feature. Any 1.4.0w
wavefront subsequent to this date will contain the indicated feature, as
will any subsequent releases.

NF-14-J107-014 Compilation switches and Stand-Alone Libraries (2010-01-11)

  The Ada leading and trailing switches are now used to compile the binder
  generated files of Stand-Alone Libraries.

NF-14-IA01-036 No relink if non interfaces of shared SALs changed (2009-10-01)

  When only non interface units are modified in a shared Stand-Alone Library,
  the shared SAL needs to be rebuilt but the executable no longer needs to be
  rebound and relinked.

NF-14-I930-029 Ignore Builder switches -x for Ada (2009-09-30)

  For better compatibility with gnatmake, switch -x is ignored when found
  in the Builder switches for Ada.

NF-14-I928-023 Library_Interface of SALs enforced (2009-09-30)

  When attribute Interfaces is not declared in a Stand-Alone Library,
  the units declared in Library_Interface constitutes the interface of
  the library. If an external unit imports a unit of the library that
  is not in Library_Interface, its compilation will be invalidated and
  gprbuild will fail.

NF-14-I814-016 gprbuild no longer outputs "creating auto.cgpr" (2009-08-20)

  When running in the default auto configuration mode, gprbuild will no
  longer display the message "creating auto.cgpr"

NF-14-I728-026 gprclean warns when object dir does not exist (2009-08-11)

  When the object dir of a project does not exist, gprclean used to exit
  with an error. Instead, it will now display a warning, and skip this
  project, but continue cleaning the other projects if required.

NF-14-I415-016 Binder generated file compiled with all options (2009-05-06)

  gprbind now compiles the binder generated file with the required trailing
  compilation switches specified in the configuration project file.

NF-14-I401-028 Support for Ada multi-unit source files (2009-09-20)

  gprbuild now supports Ada multi-unit source files

NF-14-HA27-001 New switch --no-split-units (2009-10-07)

  A new switch --no-split-units is added. When this switch is specified, the
  spec, body and subunits of an Ada unit must be sources of the same project
  or of projects extending each others.

NF-14-H828-007 Compilers working on all targets (2009-09-03)

  It is now possible in the knowledge base for gprconfig to specify
  compilers that work on all targets, by omitting the <target> node. In
  particular, you can add support for tools that generate code instead of
  object code.
