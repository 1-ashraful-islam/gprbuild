NF-14-I814-016 gprbuild no longer outputs "creating auto.cgpr" (2009-08-20)

  When running in the default auto configuration mode, gprbuild will no
  longer display the message "creating auto.cgpr"

NF-14-I728-026 gprclean warns when object dir does not exist (2009-08-11)

  When the object dir of a project does not exist, gprclean used to exit
  with an error. Instead, it will now display a warning, and skip this
  project, but continue cleaning the other projects if required.

NF-14-I713-006 Relative paths in run path option (2009-09-06)

  For platforms that support a run path option, the paths are made relative
  to the exec directory, if they have more than the root directory in common
  with the exec directory. This allows moving an executable with its shared
  libraries to a different exec directory, as long as the relative paths
  of the shared libraries are preserved.

NF-14-I415-016 Binder generated file compiled with all options (2009-05-06)

  gprbind now compiles the binder generated file with the required trailing
  compilation switches specified in the configuration project file.

NF-14-I401-028 Support for Ada multi-unit source files (2009-09-20)

  gprbuild now supports Ada multi-unit source files

NF-14-H828-007 Compilers working on all targets (2009-09-03)

  It is now possible in the knowledge base for gprconfig to specify
  compilers that work on all targets, by omitting the <target> node. In
  particular, you can add support for tools that generate code instead of
  object code.
