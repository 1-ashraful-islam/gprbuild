Copyright (C) 2012-2013, AdaCore

This file contains a complete list of new features in version 2.1 of GPRBUILD.
A full description of all GPRBUILD features can be found in the GPRBUILD
User's Guide.

NF-21-M918-043 Attributes External and environment variables (2013-09-19)

  In main aggregate project, when attribute External is specified, the
  corresponding environment variable is set, if it is not already set in the
  environment.

NF-21-M719-035 -b, -c and -l may be used in package Builder (2013-08-08)

  The switches -c, -b and -l are no longer restricted to the command line. They
  may be specified in package Builder of the main project.

NF-21-M719-029 --no-object-check may be used in package Builder (2013-07-21)

  The gprbuild switch --no-object-check is no longer restricted to the command
  line. It may be specified in package Builder of the main project file.

NF-21-M714-001 Binding several executables simultaneously (2013-07-17)

  gprbuild is now able to bind several executables simultaneously when
  switch -jnnn is used, with nnn other than 1.

NF-21-M529-021 Clean artifacts in object and exec directories (2013-06-18)

  gprclean now cleans from the object directory the files specified in
  new attribute Artifacts_In_Object_Dir in package Clean and for main projects
  cleans from the exec directory the files specified in new attribute
  Artifacts_In_Exec_Dir in package Clean.

NF-21-M405-028 gprinstall now supports cross-environment (2013-04-05)

  gprinstall will work in cross-environment by using the newly added
  --target option. This way it is possible to install a .dll created
  from a Windows cross-compiler on GNU/Linux for example.

NF-21-M304-056 gprinstall now preserves timestamps (2013-03-05)

  gprinstall now preserves timestamps when copying the source files,
  object files and libraries.

NF-21-LC19-034 Project_Path searched before ADA_PROJECT_PATH (2013-01-04)

  Project_Path values are searched before ADA_PROJECT_PATH. This behavior
  is better as if Project_Path is defined for the aggregate project we
  do not want to pick a random project found in ADA_PROJECT_PATH.

NF-21-LA25-026 Aggregate projects and auto-configuration (2012-01-11)

  gprbuild fails when the project tree includes only aggregate projects and
  aggregate libraries projects. When gprbuild is called with a main project
  that is either an aggregate project or an aggregate library project,
  if auto-configuration is used, the configuration project file is created
  in the object directory of one of the non aggregate projects in the project
  tree.

NF-21-LA22-030 New Linker attribute Trailing_Switches (2012-12-29)

  A new attribute Trailing_Switches has been added in package Linker of
  project files. These switches are added in the linking command line
  after the required switches, so that they can override these switches.

NF-21-LA05-034 --config= in Builder switches (2012-12-24)

  gprbuild now takes into account a switch --config= in package Builder
  of the main project.

NF-21-L809-007 Non Ada sources copied to the Library_Src_Dir (2013-06-24)

  In a library project, when attributes Library_Src_Dir and Interfaces are
  declared and there are non Ada sources/templates in the Interfaces,
  these sources/templates are now copied to the Library_Src_Dir.

NF-21-L724-003 Empty Run_Path_Origin (2013-02-05)

  It is now allowed to specify attribute Run_Path_Origin as an empty
  string. This allows the run paths to be absolute paths. Then an executable
  may be moved to another directory without moving the shared libraries
  it needs.

NF-21-KB01-015 libstdc++.so directory in run path option (2013-06-26)

  A new configuration attribute Library_Rpath_Options is created. The main
  goal of this attribute is to make sure that shared libraries with C++ code
  are linked with a run path option that includes the directory of the
  correct libstdc++.so.

NF-21-K826-028 Add support for distributed compilation (2012-12-19)

  It is now possible to use multiple computers to conduct the compilations.
  This can give good speed-up for large projects.

NF-21-K314-016 Linking several executables simultaneously (2013-07-14)

  gprbuild is now able to link several executables simultaneously when
  switch -jnnn is used, with nnn other than 1.
