Copyright (C) 2012-2013, AdaCore

This file contains a complete list of new features in version 2.0 of GPRBUILD.
A full description of all GPRBUILD features can be found in the GPRBUILD
User's Guide.

NF-21-LC19-034 Project_Path searched before ADA_PROJECT_PATH (2013-01-04)

  Project_Path values are searched before ADA_PROJECT_PATH. This behavior
  is better as if Project_Path is defined for the aggregate project we
  do not want to pick a random project found in ADA_PROJECT_PATH.

NF-21-LA22-030 New Linker attribute Trailing_Switches (2012-12-29)

  A new attribute Trailing_Switches has been added in package Linker of
  project files. These switches are added in the linking command line
  after the required switches, so that they can override these switches.

NF-21-LA05-034 --config= in Builder switches (2012-12-24)

  gprbuild now takes into account a switch --config= in package Builder
  of the main project.

NF-21-K826-028 Add support for distributed compilation (2012-12-19)

  It is now possible to use multiple computers to conduct the compilations.
  This can give good speed-up for large projects.
