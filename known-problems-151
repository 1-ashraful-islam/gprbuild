KP-151-K125-041 No binding of locally removed sources

  Problem:    When the main is not in Ada and there are no Roots specified,
              an attempt is made to bind locally removed Ada sources, resulting
              in a gprbuild crash.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.6.0 on 2011-02-02

  Workaround: Remove the sources instead of declaring them locally removed.
