The following is a listing of known problems in release 1.5.1. Except where
specifically noted, all these problems have been corrected in the development
tree of the 1.6 technology. This means they are corrected in any 1.6.0w
wavefront issued subsequent to the date specified (in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD) in
the status line. This can be used to determine if a given wavefront has the fix
identified in the entry.

KP-151-JC22-022 Duplicate rpaths when there are several mains

  Problem:    gprbuild keeps the rpaths from the previous mains when linking
              another main. That may leads to reach a limit in some platforms,
              and the link may then fail.

  Status      This was fixed in 1.6.0 on 2010-12-29

  Workaround: Invoke gprbuild to link one main at a time.

KP-151-JC09-012 Main in mixed cases on Windows

  Problem:    On Windows, if the mains in attributes Mains contain capital
              letters, linking executables may fail.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.6.0 on 2011-01-07

  Workaround: Use only small letters in attribute Main.

KP-151-J512-013 gprconfig's <executable> requires a prefix

  Problem:    In its knowledge base, gprconfig requires a valid prefix
              attribute for <executable> nodes.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.6.0 on 2010-12-01

  Workaround: Add prefix="-1" to <executable>
