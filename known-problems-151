The following is a listing of known problems in release 1.5.1. Except where
specifically noted, all these problems have been corrected in the development
tree of the 1.6 technology. This means they are corrected in any 1.6.0w
wavefront issued subsequent to the date specified (in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD) in
the status line. This can be used to determine if a given wavefront has the fix
identified in the entry.

KP-151-K309-002 Multi-unit file on command line should compile all units

  Problem:    If you specify a multi-unit source file on the command line,
              only one of the units within that file is compiled.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.6.0 on 2011-03-09

  Workaround: Use the switch -eI.. to specify each of the units to compile.

KP-151-K228-036 Builder'Switches ("Ada") not taken into account

  Problem:    If the name of the language is not in lower case in
              Builder'Switches ("<language>"), the attribute is not taken
              into account.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.6.0 on 2011-02-28

  Workaround: Use language names in lower case.

KP-151-K223-005 Bad handling of pragmas Linker_Options and Link_With

  Problem:    On Windows, the stack for executables with tasking is incorrectly
              specified to the linker.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.6.0 on 2011-02-24

  Workaround: Use gnatmake instead of gprbuild for linking.

KP-151-K209-050 Crash when main is an excluded file

  Problem:    When one of the main is also an excluded source file, gprbuild
              crashes when attempting to check if the main needs to be
              compiled.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.6.0 on 2011-02-10

  Workaround: Remove the main from the list of excluded source files.

KP-151-K125-041 No binding of locally removed sources

  Problem:    When the main is not in Ada and there are no Roots specified,
              an attempt is made to bind locally removed Ada sources, resulting
              in a gprbuild crash.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.5.2 on 2011-02-02

  Workaround: Remove the sources instead of declaring them locally removed.

KP-151-JC23-006 Link time error on big projects with powerpc-elf

  Problem:    When linking projects with a sufficiently big number of units the
              link phase fails with missing symbol errors. This is a command
              line limitation error when gprbuild calls the linker.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.6.0 on 2011-03-16

  Workaround: force the use of a response file by using the following
              attributes in package Linker:
                for Max_Command_Line_Length use "8000";
                for Response_File_Format use "GNU";
